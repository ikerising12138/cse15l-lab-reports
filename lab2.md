**part 3**

Something I learned in this week's lab is how to properly use JUnit 4 for asserting code. What I did not know before is how to assert whether two doubles are equal. It turned out that 
we need to add an extra parameter *Delta* after the assertion to specify the precision, or the gap between the two doubles.
