In this tutorial, we will be providing a step-by-step guide on how to connect to a remote server via a course-specific account on *ieng6* .

## Step 1: Download VSCode

**Note**: If you do not wish to download external apps onto your PC, you can use the PCs located in the CSE building's basement and proceed to the next step.

1. Go to Visual Studio Code's [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the environment that suits your working environment (e.g. MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc.)

***

2. Launch Visual Studio Code (you should see the welcome page)

6. Go to your terminal. Type `ssh *YOUR_ACCOUNT*@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (e.g. `ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`)

***

7. The server will ask for your password by showing `Password: `. Enter the password (note that what you enter will not be present on screen)
